# Context
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

# Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.


# Autoencoder (undercomplete)
An interesting feature of this architecture is its ability to encode data into its representations containing fewer features (latent representation). During training, the measure of faithful reproduction of input data is defined by the reconstruction error.

# Future tasks:

Use a better model by using hyperparameter optimization.\
Analyze the data to understand the features.\
Compare these results to a common approach like SVM or K-means clustering.
